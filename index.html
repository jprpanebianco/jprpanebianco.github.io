					<p style="color:black;" >Here's a prototype for a game idea I had. I thought breakout games would be a lot more fun if there was more to do
                        with the ball. So, I decided to try seeing if it would be fun if th eball could jump. From there, it was worth trying to make the ball
                        do a ground pound.<br>Use the mouse to move the paddle.<br>Use the left mouse button to fire the ball, make it jump, and, while it's
                        airborne, do a ground pound.<br>Collect the purple gems while the ball does all the work.</p>
