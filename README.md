My Resume Website
=================
## Concept
I just wanted the website to provide the bare minimum: my prototypes, projects and resume. Mostly, it's just a bunch of links to here. I went for a modern feel, even though that's not usually what I go for. If you like what you see, or have questions, reach out. Thanks!
